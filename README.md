# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure: Uninformative Error Message

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command. The `expo prebuild` process fails without providing a detailed error message, making debugging difficult. The project builds successfully on a simulator but fails when attempting to create a standalone app.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run `expo prebuild`.

The `expo prebuild` command will likely fail without a clear indication of the cause.

## Potential Solutions (and why they didn't work in my case)

* **Clearing the cache:** Tried `expo prebuild --clear` and deleting the `.expo` directory.  No change.
* **Reinstalling dependencies:** Tried `npm install` and `yarn install`. No change.
* **Checking the Expo config:** Reviewed the `app.json` and `app.config.js` files for any potential issues. No change.
