While using Expo CLI, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message wasn't very informative, simply stating that the prebuild process failed without specifics. I've tried various troubleshooting steps, including cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking my Expo config, but the issue persists. The project builds fine on a simulator, but fails during the prebuild stage when attempting to create a standalone app.
